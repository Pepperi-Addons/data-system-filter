/**
 * This class was created to handle bug DI-25619 which caused filters to be duplicated.
 * 
 * The duplication is now blocked in {@link FilterObjectService}, but because non 'Sync' filter-rules can
 * have multiple mappings to the same resource (by design), there is no guard against duplicating those filter-rules,
 * which causes them to point to the 'extra' filters.
 * 
 * 'Sync' filter-rules DOES have validation against duplication ({@link FilterRuleService.validateProfileFilterCombination})
 * which grantees that there will be no duplication and that they will 
 * point to the correct filter.
